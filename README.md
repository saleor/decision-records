## Quo valid Saleor?
In the spirit of transparency we are opening up our internal decision making process. When making a decision around how to fix a bug or introduce even a small change in the code you need to know what is the overall aim. Internally we write down those decisions. Even if these are implicit decisions done a few years ago, we are backfilling those and getting them up to date.

## How decisions are made in Saleor?
We are following the concept of Decision Records for everything from technical RFCs, Architecture Decision Records, and Product Decision Records. Internally the process is very lean, we write a short doc, put it out to get feedback, and after a few days mark as accepted. This way we make sure people can reference the decisions and are empowered to make daily decisions in line with the general direction.

## What is this repository?
We would like to get more eyes on the decisions we are making especially when they are touching developers working with our open source bits. We regularly get pull requests we cannot accept because they are not in line with the direction we want to take. It's wasted energy and effort for the contributors and it's sad when we need to tell a fellow engineer their contribution is so far away it will just not do. We hope with this repository it's going to be easier for people to get where Saleor is going and make contributions along with it. In many cases this will also help engineers make decisions around their own solution, such that they will have less work in the future, once we introduce changes.
